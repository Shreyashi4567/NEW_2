          Plot: A Bustling city, there lived a woman named Maya. A talented
          graphic designer, she found joy in crafting vibrant worlds on her
          screen. Yet, beneath her vibrant exterior lay a haunting truth. One
          evening, as she was returning home from a late-night client meeting,
          she became a victim of an attempted mugging. The incident left her
          shaken, her sense of safety shattered like glass.

          For weeks, Maya struggled to reclaim her former self. The vibrant
          colors she once painted now appeared dull, and the world outside felt
          like a lurking predator. Fear gripped her heart, chaining her to her
          apartment. She avoided late nights and crowded places, retreating into
          the safety of her four walls. But within those walls, a fire
          flickeredâ€”a determination to rise above the darkness that had engulfed
          her. One fateful day, as she scrolled through her social media, Maya
          stumbled upon a local self-defense workshop for women. It was a simple
          ad, but it sparked a flicker of hope within her. She hesitated for a
          moment, recalling the fear that had kept her silent for so long. But
          then she remembered the vibrant woman she once was and the designs she
          had brought to life. Inspired, she signed up.
